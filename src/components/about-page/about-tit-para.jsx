            Why did we want to make a page like this? Well, there were countless times in College 
            when I (Damon) was doing Econometrics projects that I thought “WOW”, I really do not 
            know what I am doing in terms of coding. I would sometimes write 400-500 lines of code 
            where if I had done my research online and checked out some of these resources, I could 
            have completed the steps in 80-100. <br/><br/>
            Also, coming out of college I had no idea what Github was. I had heard of it, 
            and knew it was something to do with programming but never knew how it worked. 
            Since about March of 2020, I have really delved into programming and realized 
            just how crucial Github is. Now, again you might be thinking 
            “Wait, I don’t want to go into programming?”, well, Github is not just 
            used for programming purposes but also collaborating between colleagues 
            so you can work on projects together. A lot of Data Analysts (such as Dan) 
            use it regularly in their jobs. <br/><br/>
            <strong style = {{color: "red"}}>[maybe Dan, add something here if you want]</strong> <br/><br/>
            Anyway, we hope you like this page, and can find some use out of it. If you have any questions don’t hesitate to contact via Email or LinkedIn.
