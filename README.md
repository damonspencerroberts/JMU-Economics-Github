# JMU ECONOMICS GITHUB

### Github
This is a resource page for **Economics** students. The site has helpful resources to navigate through Github. 

### Coding Resources
The site also includes resources for some of the most popular tools in the Data Science field.

##### Creation
The site was created with React. I wanted to make a site that was easy to navigate, that was appealing to the user and gave some great resources to Economics students. The styling was done with a mix of Styling Components, React Bootstrap and external CSS.
